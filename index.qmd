title: "I am a 4th year undergraduate student at the University of California, Santa Barbara, pursuing a major in Environmental Studies (B.S), with an outside emphasis in Chemistry. I love to get active, mainly in the form of weightlifting at the local rec-cen on campus, but I'll always find time to get in a hike, camping trip, pick-up game of football, or anything that comes my way. I love studying, learning, improving, and truly challenging myself."
