These are some of the places that I have been fortunate enough to travel to.

Each has shaped be differently, contributing to a part of who I am, which I appreciate immensely.

Making Anywhere Feel like Home;

Having travelled a fair amount, I've come to realize that while amazing to be able to experience the joy of expxloring new places, there is never going to be somewhere that can replace my home. As a tool of grounding, recreation, and pure leasiure, this is the playlist that I created with the intention of being able to feel at home and listen to on the daily, regardless of where I may be.
