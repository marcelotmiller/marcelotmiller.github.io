title: "Caffeine Consumption - Life of a Busy College Student"
---

During the last month and a half I have recorded the amount of caffeine that I, a full time college senior and part time worker, has consumed. I have included the potential variables of whether or not I have homework or an exam due, how many classes I had, if I worked out that day, my wake up time, along with hours slept.

The primary predictor variable that I chose to analyze was whether homework or an exam was due that day, with the response variable being the caffeine intake in mg.

```{r warning=FALSE, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE}


library(tidyverse)
# loading and cleaning data
data <- read_csv("data_trial_june1st")

clean_data <- data |>
  filter(!is.na(`Caffeine (mg)`), !is.na(`HW/Exam Due`)) |>
  select(`HW/Exam Due`, `Caffeine (mg)`)

# summarize the mean of the caffeine consumption in Yes/No groups
caffeine_summary <- clean_data |>
  group_by(`HW/Exam Due`) |>
  summarize(mean_caffeine = mean(`Caffeine (mg)`), .groups = "drop")

# create plot with two categories and clear tick marks for caffeine (mg) on y-axis
ggplot(clean_data, aes(x = `HW/Exam Due`, y = `Caffeine (mg)`, color = `HW/Exam Due`)) +
