I have included the potential variables of whether or not I have homework or an exam due, how many classes I had, if I worked out that day, my wake up time, along with hours slept.\nThe primary predictor variable that I chose to analyze was whether homework or an exam was due that day, with the response variable being the caffeine intake in mg."
